**User Request:** i deployed it on netlify i get ðŸ”Ž Why You Got 403  
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 403 () /api/reddit?subreddiâ€¦&limit=100&t=week:1 
this is what chatgpt said 

CORS restriction

Reddit blocks cross-origin requests from browsers (Netlify frontend â†’ reddit.com/json).

That's why your fetch fails even if the URL works fine in your browser.

Missing authentication (if using the Reddit API)

If you're hitting the official Reddit API (api.reddit.com), you must include a Bearer token in the request headers.

Without it, Reddit replies with 403 Forbidden.

âœ… Solution: Use a Netlify Function as Proxy

Instead of calling Reddit directly from the browser, call your own Netlify serverless function, and let it talk to Reddit.
That way:

CORS isn't a problem (server â†’ server).

You can safely add Reddit API authentication.

Example: netlify/functions/reddit.js
import fetch from "node-fetch";

export async function handler(event) {
  const { subreddit = "python", limit = 100, t = "week" } = event.queryStringParameters;

  // ðŸ”‘ If using official Reddit API with OAuth
  // Replace with your Reddit app's client_id + client_secret
  const auth = Buffer.from(`${process.env.REDDIT_CLIENT_ID}:${process.env.REDDIT_SECRET}`).toString("base64");

  // Get a temporary access token
  const tokenResponse = await fetch("https://www.reddit.com/api/v1/access_token", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Authorization": `Basic ${auth}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
    },
    body: "grant_type=client_credentials"
  });

  const tokenData = await tokenResponse.json();

  // Fetch from Reddit API
  const url = `https://oauth.reddit.com/r/${subreddit}/top?t=${t}&limit=${limit}`;
  const response = await fetch(url, {
    headers: {
      "Authorization": `Bearer ${tokenData.access_token}`,
      "User-Agent": "netlify-reddit-proxy/1.0"
    }
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    return { statusCode: response.status, body: `Error: ${response.statusText}` };
  }

  const data = await response.json();
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify(data),
  };
}

How It Works

Your frontend calls:

/.netlify/functions/reddit?subreddit=python&limit=100&t=week


The Netlify function:

Authenticates with Reddit (using your client_id + secret stored in Netlify environment variables).

Gets an access token.

Fetches posts from Reddit API.

Returns JSON to your frontend.

âœ… With this, you'll fix the 403 issue and can pull >100 posts by looping pages.
**Response Summary:** Successfully implemented comprehensive Netlify Functions solution to resolve CORS and authentication issues for Reddit API integration:

**Netlify Functions Implementation:**
- Created `netlify/functions/reddit.js` serverless function as proxy for Reddit API calls
- Implemented dual authentication system: falls back to Reddit JSON feeds if credentials unavailable, uses OAuth when credentials provided
- Added proper CORS headers and error handling for all response scenarios
- Supports both post fetching and comments retrieval through single endpoint
- Includes comprehensive error logging and timeout handling

**CORS Resolution Architecture:**
- Replaced Next.js API routes with Netlify Functions to solve deployment CORS issues
- Updated frontend API calls from `/api/reddit` to `/.netlify/functions/reddit`
- Configured proper serverless function structure compatible with Netlify deployment
- Removed conflicting Next.js API routes that caused static export issues

**Authentication & Environment Setup:**
- Added Reddit API credentials to environment configuration (.env file)
- Implemented OAuth flow with client credentials grant for authenticated requests
- Created fallback system using Reddit JSON feeds when credentials not provided
- Added comprehensive environment variable documentation and setup instructions

**Static Export Configuration:**
- Updated Next.js config for static export compatible with Netlify hosting
