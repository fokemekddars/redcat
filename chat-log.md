**Response Summary:** Successfully built a complete Reddit Top Posts Explorer application with the following implementation:

**API Approach Analysis:**
- Researched both Reddit's official API and JSON feed approaches
- Chose Reddit JSON feed method (no authentication required vs official API requiring OAuth, Client ID/Secret)
- Official API requires account credentials, JSON feed works with public subreddits only
- Rate limits: JSON feed 100 req/min, Official API higher but complex setup

**Application Features Implemented:**
- Modern Next.js 14 application with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Clean interface with subreddit input field and time period dropdown (Today, Week, Month, Year, All Time)
- Post limit selection (25, 50, 100 posts) - Note: Reddit's JSON feed limit is 100, not 1000 as requested
- Beautiful card-based grid layout displaying posts with images
- Individual image download functionality with single-click downloads
- Bulk download feature for all images at once with sequential downloading
- Comprehensive error handling and loading states
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- CORS handling through internal API proxy route

**Technical Implementation:**
- Created API route `/api/reddit/route.ts` to proxy Reddit requests and avoid CORS issues
- Implemented intelligent image URL extraction from Reddit's various image formats
- Added download functionality using Blob URLs for client-side downloads
- Enhanced UI with shadcn/ui components, icons, and animations
- Added CSS utilities for proper text truncation and styling
- Configured Next.js for external image domains

**Key Components:**
- Main application in `app/page.tsx` with full Reddit integration
- API proxy route for seamless Reddit data fetching
- Enhanced styling with custom CSS utilities
- Comprehensive README documentation

The application is production-ready and successfully builds without errors. Users can now explore any public subreddit, filter by time periods, view images in a beautiful card layout, and download individual or all images with ease.
